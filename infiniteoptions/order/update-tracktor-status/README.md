## Setup

- In the `Infinite Options Order Created` Action, specify the field name of the Infinite Options field that should trigger the status update. For information on how to locate the field name in Infinite Options, check out our [documentation](https://docs.theshoppad.com/article/122-why-are-option-selections-labeled-infiniteoptions1).
- In the `Tracktor Update Manual Status Order` Action, specify the status that the order should be set to. A common use case is to set the order status to "Customizing" when the order contains customizations from Infinite Options. If you decide to use a custom status, ensure that it exists in Tracktor before trying to use this automation. More information on custom statuses can be found [here](https://docs.theshoppad.com/article/361-custom-tracktor-statuses#t1).
- Enable the Automation and click **Save**.
