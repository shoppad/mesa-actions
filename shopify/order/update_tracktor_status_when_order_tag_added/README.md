## Setup

- Create a "Preparing your order" custom status in your Tracktor dashboard.  Optionally, if you would like to use a different status, open the `Mapping to Tracktor Status` step and change the `status` value.
- Optionally, if you would like to use a Shopify order tag besides `made to order`, open the `Filter by Order Tag` step and change the `made to order` text.
- Enable the Automation in the right sidebar and click **Save**.
