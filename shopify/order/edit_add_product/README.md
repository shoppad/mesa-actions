## Setup

- Open the `Configuration` and set the "product_variant_id" line to the [Variant ID](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/os/using-themes/change-the-layout/find-variant-id) of the Product you would like to add to the order.
- Enable the Automation and click Save.

## Optional Customizations

- Adjust the Note that is added to the order (or do not add a note at all) by changing the `order_note` line.
- Change the amount that needs to be spent to qualify for the free product, or change it to look at the total after shipping and taxes, rather than just to line items' subtotal by modifying the `Filter` step.
- If the selected product variant is not free, your customers will be sent an email with a link to pay the amount of the new product. The product will not be added to the cart until the customer completes the second checkout.  Imagine all of the interesting ways you could use this workflow to enhnace your customers' shopping experience!
